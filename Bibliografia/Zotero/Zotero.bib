We concentrate our attention at mid-rapidity and solve the equations event-by-event imposing boost-invariance. For \$p\_T {\textbackslash}gtrsim 1\$ GeV the anisotropic flow is found to be considerably enhanced, if the dijets deposit on average more than 12 GeV in the medium (or equivalently 6 GeV for each jet of the pair), which corresponds, in our model, to an average suppression greater than \$65{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the initial jet transverse energy.},

	abstract = {We construct a hadronic equation of state consistent with chemical freezeout and discuss how such an equation of state modifies the radial and elliptic flow in a hydrodynamic + hadronic cascade model of relativistic heavy ion collisions at the SPS. Incorporating chemical freezeout does not change the relation between pressure and energy density. However, it does change the relation between temperature and energy density. Consequently, when the hydrodynamic solution and freezeout are expressed in terms of energy density, chemical freezeout does not modify the hydrodynamic radial and elliptic flow velocities studied previously. Finally, we examine chemical freezeout within the hadronic cascade (RQMD). Once chemical freezeout is incorporated into the hydrodynamics, the final spectra and fireball lifetimes are insensitive to the temperature at which the switch from hydrodynamics to cascade is made. Closer inspection indicates that the pion spectrum in chemically frozen hydrodynamics is significantly cooler than in the hydro+cascade model. This difference is reflected in \$v\_\{2\}(p\_\{T\})\$. We extract the freezeout hadron density in RQMD and interpret it in thermal terms; the freezeout hadron density corresponds to a freezeout temperature of \$T\_\{f\}{\textbackslash}approx100 \$ MeV and \${\textbackslash}mu\_\{{\textbackslash}pi\} {\textbackslash}approx 80 \$ MeV.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01974},
	abstract = {A hot, dense medium called a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) is created in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. Hard parton scatterings generate high momentum partons that traverse the medium, which then fragment into sprays of particle called jets. Experimental measurements from high momentum hadrons, two particle correlations, and full jet reconstruction at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) continue to improve our understanding of energy loss in the QGP. Run 2 at the LHC recently began and there is a jet detector at RHIC under development. Now is the perfect time to reflect on what the experimental measurements have taught us so far, the limitations of the techniques used for studying jets, how the techniques can be improved, and how to move forward with the wealth of experimental data such that a complete description of energy loss in the QGP can be achieved. Measurements of jets to date clearly indicate that hard partons lose energy. Detailed comparisons of the nuclear modification factor between data and model calculations led to quantitative constraints on the opacity of the medium to hard probes. While there is substantial evidence for softening and broadening jets through medium interactions, the difficulties comparing measurements to theoretical calculations limit further quantitative constraints on energy loss mechanisms. We call for an agreement between theorists and experimentalists on the appropriate treatment of the background, Monte Carlo generators that enable experimental algorithms to be applied to theoretical calculations, and a clear understanding of which observables are most sensitive to the properties of the medium, even in the presence of background. This will enable us to determine the best strategy for the field to improve quantitative constraints on properties of the medium in the face of these challenges.},

In this comparison, an identical medium evolution will be utilized for all three approaches: not only does this entail the use of the same realistic three-dimensional relativistic fluid dynamics (RFD) simulation, but also includes the use of identical initial parton-distribution functions and final fragmentation functions. We are, thus, in a unique position, not only to isolate fundamental differences between the various approaches, but also to make rigorous calculations for different experimental measurements using "state of the art" components. All three approaches are reduced to a version which contains only one free tunable parameter, this is then related to the well known transport parameter \${\textbackslash}hat\{q\}\$. We find that the parameters of all three calculations can be adjusted to provide a good description of inclusive data on \$R\_\{AA\}\$ versus transverse momentum. However, we do observe slight differences in their predictions for the centrality and azimuthal angular dependence of \$R\_\{AA\}\$ vs. \$p\_T\$. We also note that the value of the transport coefficient \${\textbackslash}hat\{q\}\$ in the three approaches to describe the data differs significantly.},

	abstract = {Angular structure of radiative and collisional energy losses of a hard parton jet propagating through dense QCD-matter is investigated. For small angular jet cone sizes, \${\textbackslash}theta\_0 {\textless} 5{\textasciicircum}0\$, the radiative energy loss is shown to dominate over the collisional energy loss due to final state elastic rescattering of the hard projectile on thermal particles in the medium. Due to coherent effects, the radiative energy loss decreases with increasing the angular size the jet. It becomes comparable with the collisional energy loss for \${\textbackslash}theta\_0 {\textgreater} 5{\textasciicircum}0-10{\textasciicircum}0\$.},

	abstract = {This is a review of the theoretical background, experimental techniques, and phenomenology of what is called the "Glauber Model" in relativistic heavy ion physics. This model is used to calculate "geometric" quantities, which are typically expressed as impact parameter (b), number of participating nucleons (N\_part) and number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions (N\_coll). A brief history of the original Glauber model is presented, with emphasis on its development into the purely classical, geometric picture that is used for present-day data analyses. Distinctions are made between the "optical limit" and Monte Carlo approaches, which are often used interchangably but have some essential differences in particular contexts. The methods used by the four RHIC experiments are compared and contrasted, although the end results are reassuringly similar for the various geometric observables. Finally, several important RHIC measurements are highlighted that rely on geometric quantities, estimated from Glauber calculations, to draw insight from experimental observables. The status and future of Glauber modeling in the next generation of heavy ion physics studies is briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {Jet quenching and more generally physics at high transverse momentum P\_T scales is a cornerstone of the heavy-ion physics program at the LHC. In this work, the current understanding of jet quenching in terms of a QCD shower evolution being modified by the surrounding medium is reviewed along with the evidence for this picture from light parton high P\_T observables. Conceptually, the same QCD shower description should also be relevant for heavy quarks, but with several important modifications introduced by the quark masses. Thus especially in the limit of small jet energy over quark mass E\_jet/m\_q, the relevant physics may be rather different from light quark jets, and several attempts to explain the observed phenomenology of heavy quarks at high P\_T are discussed here.},

	abstract = {The mass of heavy quarks, such as charm and bottom, plays an important role in the formation of parton showers. This effect is apparently not well understood when parton showers evolve in a strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma. We propose a new experimental measurement in relativistic heavy ion collisions, based on a two-prong subjet structure inside a reconstructed heavy flavor jet, which can place stringent constraints on the mass dependence of in-medium splitting functions. We identify the region of jet transverse momenta where parton mass effects are leading and predict a unique reversal of the mass hierarchy of jet quenching effects in heavy ion relative to proton collisions. Namely, the momentum sharing distribution of prompt \$b\$-tagged jets is more strongly modified in comparison to the one for light jets. Our work is useful in guiding experimental efforts at the Large Hadron Collider and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in the near future.},
