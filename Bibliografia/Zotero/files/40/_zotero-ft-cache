High Energy Physics - Phenomenology
Title: 3+1D hydrodynamic simulation of relativistic heavy-ion collisions

    Abstract: We present MUSIC, an implementation of the Kurganov-Tadmor algorithm for relativistic 3+1 dimensional fluid dynamics in heavy-ion collision scenarios. This Riemann-solver-free, second-order, high-resolution scheme is characterized by a very small numerical viscosity and its ability to treat shocks and discontinuities very well. We also incorporate a sophisticated algorithm for the determination of the freeze-out surface using a three dimensional triangulation of the hyper-surface. Implementing a recent lattice based equation of state, we compute p_T-spectra and pseudorapidity distributions for Au+Au collisions at root s = 200 GeV and present results for the anisotropic flow coefficients v_2 and v_4 as a function of both p_T and pseudorapidity. We were able to determine v_4 with high numerical precision, finding that it does not strongly depend on the choice of initial condition or equation of state.
