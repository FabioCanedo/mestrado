HYDJET event generator

Purpose

HYDJET is event generator to simulate jet production, jet quenching and flow effects in ultrarelativistic heavy ion AA collisions
Method

This code is merging HYDRO (flow effects), PYTHIA6.4 (hard jet production) and PYQUEN (jet quenching).
The development of HYDJET generator is HYDJET++ project.
