Title: Jet quenching in QCD matter: from RHIC to LHC
Authors: David d'Enterria
(Submitted on 15 Feb 2009 ( v1 ), last revised 23 Mar 2009 (this version, v2))

    Abstract: The current experimental and theoretical status of hadron and jet production at large transverse momentum in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions is summarised. The most important RHIC results are compared to theoretical parton energy loss predictions providing direct information on the (thermo)dynamical properties of hot and dense QCD matter. Prospects for the LHC are also outlined.
