High Energy Physics - Phenomenology
Title: Jet Phenomenology
Authors: Michael H. Seymour (RAL)
(Submitted on 14 Jul 1997 ( v1 ), last revised 3 Aug 1997 (this version, v3))

    Abstract: We discuss the phenomenology of jet physics at hadron colliders, concentrating on the internal structure of jets, which is studied using the jet shape distribution or subjet distributions.
