High Energy Physics - Phenomenology
Title: Recent Developments in the Lund Model
Authors: Bo Andersson , Sandipan Mohanty , Fredrik Soderberg
(Submitted on 9 Dec 2002)

    Abstract: A brief introduction to the String Fragmentation Model and its consequences is presented. We discuss the fragmentation of a general multi-gluon string and show that it can be formulated as the production of a set of ''plaquettes'' between the hadronic curve and the directrix. We also discuss certain interesting scaling properties of the partonic states obtained from standard parton shower algorithms like those in Pythia and Ariadne, which are communicated to the final state hadrons obtained through our hadronisation procedure.
