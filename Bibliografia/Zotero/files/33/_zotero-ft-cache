Title: Jet quenching: an iconic result revisited
Authors: Christine Nattrass
(Submitted on 27 Jan 2018)

    Abstract: Early measurements at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) demonstrated jet quenching through the suppression of pairs of high momentum hadrons. These dihadron correlations have a large correlated background. As our understanding improved, we realized that a significant term was omitted from the background and several dihadron correlation results were quantitatively and qualitatively incorrect. The original measurements demonstrating jet quenching have not been revisited. These measurements are repeated in this paper in a kinematic range similar to the original measurement using publicly available data, applying our current knowledge about the background. The new results are qualitatively consistent with the previous results, demonstrating complete suppression of the away-side within uncertainties.
