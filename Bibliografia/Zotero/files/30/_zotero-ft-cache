    Abstract: The heavy ion event generator HYDJET++ is presented. HYDJET++ simulates relativistic heavy ion AA collisions as a superposition of the soft, hydro-type state and the hard state resulting from multi-parton fragmentation. This model is the development and continuation of HYDJET event generator. The hard parts of HYDJET and HYDJET++ are identical. The soft part of HYDJET++ contains the following important additional features as compared with HYDJET: resonance decays and more detailed treatment of thermal and chemical freeze-out hypersurfaces. HYDJET++ is capable of reproducing the bulk properties of heavy ion collisions at RHIC (hadron spectra and ratios, radial and elliptic flow, femtoscopic momentum correlations), as well as high-pT hadron spectra. Some applications of HYDJET++ at LHC are discussed.
