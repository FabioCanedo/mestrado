	abstract = {We construct a hadronic equation of state consistent with chemical freezeout and discuss how such an equation of state modifies the radial and elliptic flow in a hydrodynamic + hadronic cascade model of relativistic heavy ion collisions at the SPS. Incorporating chemical freezeout does not change the relation between pressure and energy density. However, it does change the relation between temperature and energy density. Consequently, when the hydrodynamic solution and freezeout are expressed in terms of energy density, chemical freezeout does not modify the hydrodynamic radial and elliptic flow velocities studied previously. Finally, we examine chemical freezeout within the hadronic cascade (RQMD). Once chemical freezeout is incorporated into the hydrodynamics, the final spectra and fireball lifetimes are insensitive to the temperature at which the switch from hydrodynamics to cascade is made. Closer inspection indicates that the pion spectrum in chemically frozen hydrodynamics is significantly cooler than in the hydro+cascade model. This difference is reflected in $v_{2}(p_{T})$. We extract the freezeout hadron density in RQMD and interpret it in thermal terms; the freezeout hadron density corresponds to a freezeout temperature of $T_{f}{\textbackslash}textbackslashapprox100 $ MeV and ${\textbackslash}textbackslashmu_{{\textbackslash}textbackslashpi} {\textbackslash}textbackslashapprox 80 $ MeV.},

	title = {Review of {Jet} {Measurements} in {Heavy} {Ion} {Collisions}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01974},
	abstract = {A hot, dense medium called a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) is created in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. Hard parton scatterings generate high momentum partons that traverse the medium, which then fragment into sprays of particle called jets. Experimental measurements from high momentum hadrons, two particle correlations, and full jet reconstruction at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) continue to improve our understanding of energy loss in the QGP. Run 2 at the LHC recently began and there is a jet detector at RHIC under development. Now is the perfect time to reflect on what the experimental measurements have taught us so far, the limitations of the techniques used for studying jets, how the techniques can be improved, and how to move forward with the wealth of experimental data such that a complete description of energy loss in the QGP can be achieved. Measurements of jets to date clearly indicate that hard partons lose energy. Detailed comparisons of the nuclear modification factor between data and model calculations led to quantitative constraints on the opacity of the medium to hard probes. While there is substantial evidence for softening and broadening jets through medium interactions, the difficulties comparing measurements to theoretical calculations limit further quantitative constraints on energy loss mechanisms. We call for an agreement between theorists and experimentalists on the appropriate treatment of the background, Monte Carlo generators that enable experimental algorithms to be applied to theoretical calculations, and a clear understanding of which observables are most sensitive to the properties of the medium, even in the presence of background. This will enable us to determine the best strategy for the field to improve quantitative constraints on properties of the medium in the face of these challenges.},

In this comparison, an identical medium evolution will be utilized for all three approaches: not only does this entail the use of the same realistic three-dimensional relativistic fluid dynamics (RFD) simulation, but also includes the use of identical initial parton-distribution functions and final fragmentation functions. We are, thus, in a unique position, not only to isolate fundamental differences between the various approaches, but also to make rigorous calculations for different experimental measurements using "state of the art" components. All three approaches are reduced to a version which contains only one free tunable parameter, this is then related to the well known transport parameter ${\textbackslash}textbackslashhat{q}$. We find that the parameters of all three calculations can be adjusted to provide a good description of inclusive data on $R_{AA}$ versus transverse momentum. However, we do observe slight differences in their predictions for the centrality and azimuthal angular dependence of $R_{AA}$ vs. $p_T$. We also note that the value of the transport coefficient ${\textbackslash}textbackslashhat{q}$ in the three approaches to describe the data differs significantly.},

This model is used to calculate "geometric" quantities, which are typically expressed as impact parameter (b), number of participating nucleons (N_part) and number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions (N_coll). A brief history of the original Glauber model is presented, with emphasis on its development into the purely classical, geometric picture that is used for present-day data analyses. Distinctions are made between the "optical limit" and Monte Carlo approaches, which are often used interchangably but have some essential differences in particular contexts. The methods used by the four RHIC experiments are compared and contrasted, although the end results are reassuringly similar for the various geometric observables. Finally, several important RHIC measurements are highlighted that rely on geometric quantities, estimated from Glauber calculations, to draw insight from experimental observables. The status and future of Glauber modeling in the next generation of heavy ion physics studies is briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {Jet quenching and more generally physics at high transverse momentum P_T scales is a cornerstone of the heavy-ion physics program at the LHC. In this work, the current understanding of jet quenching in terms of a QCD shower evolution being modified by the surrounding medium is reviewed along with the evidence for this picture from light parton high P_T observables. Conceptually, the same QCD shower description should also be relevant for heavy quarks, but with several important modifications introduced by the quark masses. Thus especially in the limit of small jet energy over quark mass E_jet/m_q, the relevant physics may be rather different from light quark jets, and several attempts to explain the observed phenomenology of heavy quarks at high P_T are discussed here.},

	abstract = {The mass of heavy quarks, such as charm and bottom, plays an important role in the formation of parton showers. This effect is apparently not well understood when parton showers evolve in a strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma. We propose a new experimental measurement in relativistic heavy ion collisions, based on a two-prong subjet structure inside a reconstructed heavy flavor jet, which can place stringent constraints on the mass dependence of in-medium splitting functions. We identify the region of jet transverse momenta where parton mass effects are leading and predict a unique reversal of the mass hierarchy of jet quenching effects in heavy ion relative to proton collisions. Namely, the momentum sharing distribution of prompt $b$-tagged jets is more strongly modified in comparison to the one for light jets. Our work is useful in guiding experimental efforts at the Large Hadron Collider and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in the near future.},

	abstract = {We propose two new analysis strategies for studying charm and beauty quarks at colliders. The first strategy is aimed at testing the kinematics of heavy-flavor quarks within an identified jet. Here, we use the SoftDrop jet-declustering algorithm to identify two subjets within a large-radius jet, using subjet flavor tagging to test the heavy-quark splitting functions of QCD. For subjets containing a $J / {\textbackslash}textbackslashpsi$ or ${\textbackslash}textbackslashUpsilon$, this declustering technique can also help probe the mechanism for quarkonium production. The second strategy is aimed at isolating heavy-flavor production from gluon splitting. Here, we introduce a new FlavorCone algorithm, which smoothly interpolates from well-separated heavy-quark jets to the gluon-splitting regime where jets overlap. Because of its excellent ability to identify charm and beauty hadrons, the LHCb detector is ideally suited to pursue these strategies, though similar measurements should also be possible at ATLAS and CMS. Together, these SoftDrop and FlavorCone studies should clarify a number of aspects of heavy-flavor physics at colliders, and provide crucial information needed to improve heavy-flavor modeling in parton-shower generators.},

The $R_{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm AA}$ shows a strong suppression compared to binary scaling of pp collisions at the same energy (up to a factor of 4) in the 10\% most central Pb-Pb collisions. There is a centrality trend of suppression, and a weaker suppression (down to a factor of 2) in semi-peripheral (50-80\%) collisions is observed. The suppression of electrons in this broad $p_{{\textbackslash}textbackslashrm T}$ interval indicates that both charm and beauty quarks lose energy when they traverse the hot medium formed in Pb-Pb collisions at LHC.},

	abstract = {ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose, heavy-ion detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the strong-interaction sector of the Standard Model. It is designed to address the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs. ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors. The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including currently over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes in 30 countries. Its overall dimensions are 16 × 16 × 26 m 3 with a total weight of approximately 10 000 t. The experiment consists of 18 different detector systems each with its own specific technology choice and design constraints, driven both by the physics requirements and the experimental conditions expected at LHC. The most stringent design constraint is to cope with the extreme particle multiplicity anticipated in central Pb-Pb collisions. The different subsystems were optimized to provide high-momentum resolution as well as excellent Particle Identification (PID) over a broad range in momentum, up to the highest multiplicities predicted for LHC. This will allow for comprehensive studies of hadrons, electrons, muons, and photons produced in the collision of heavy nuclei. Most detector systems are scheduled to be installed and ready for data taking by mid-2008 when the LHC is scheduled to start operation, with the exception of parts of the Photon Spectrometer (PHOS), Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) and Electro Magnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). These detectors will be completed for the high-luminosity ion run expected in 2010. This paper describes in detail the detector components as installed for the first data taking in the summer of 2008.},

	abstract = {We have developed the Monte Carlo simulation program JEWEL 1.0 (Jet Evolution With Energy Loss), which interfaces a perturbative final state parton shower with medium effects occurring in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. This is done by comparing for each jet fragment the probability of further perturbative splitting with the density-dependent probability of scattering with the medium. A simple hadronisation mechanism is included. In the absence of medium effects, we validate JEWEL against a set of benchmark jet measurements. For elastic interactions with the medium, we characterise not only the medium-induced modification of the jet, but also the jet-induced modification of the medium. Our main physics result is the observation that collisional and radiative medium modifications lead to characteristic differences in the jet fragmentation pattern, which persist above a soft background cut. We argue that this should allow to disentangle collisional and radiative parton energy loss mechanisms by measuring the n-jet fraction or a class of jet shape observables.},

	abstract = {Hadrons carrying open heavy flavor, i.e. single charm or bottom quarks, are among the key diagnostic tools available today for the hot and dense state of strongly interacting matter which is produced in collisions of heavy atomic nuclei at ultra-relativistic energies. First systematic heavy-flavor measurements in nucleus-nucleus collisions and the reference proton-proton system at Brookhaven National Laboratory's (BNL) Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) have led to tantalizing results. These studies are now continued and extended at RHIC and at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC), where considerably higher collision energies are available. This review focuses on experimental results on open heavy-flavor observables at RHIC and the LHC published until July 2012. Yields of heavy-flavor hadrons and their decay products, their transverse momentum and rapidity distributions, as well as their azimuthal distributions with respect to the reaction plane in heavy-ion collisions are investigated. Various theoretical approaches are confronted with the data and implications for the properties of the hot and dense medium produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions are discussed.},

This is followed by a brief discussion of bulk evolution models for heavy-ion collisions and initial conditions for the HQ distributions which are needed to calculate HF spectra in comparison to observables. We then turn to a discussion of experimental data that have been collected to date at RHIC and LHC, specifically for the nuclear suppression factor and elliptic flow of semileptonic HF decays, D mesons, non-prompt $J/{\textbackslash}psi$ from B-meson decays, and b-jets. Model comparisons to HF data are conducted with regards to extracting the magnitude, temperature and momentum-dependence of HF transport coefficients from experiment.},

The coupling between the jets and the medium is done through a source term in the energy-momentum conservation equations for ideal hydrodynamics. We concentrate our attention at mid-rapidity and solve the equations event-by-event imposing boost-invariance. For $p_T {\textbackslash}gtrsim 1$ GeV the anisotropic flow is found to be considerably enhanced, if the dijets deposit on average more than 12 GeV in the medium (or equivalently 6 GeV for each jet of the pair), which corresponds, in our model, to an average suppression greater than $65{\textbackslash}\%$ of the initial jet transverse energy.},

	abstract = {High $p_T {\textgreater} 10$ GeV elliptic flow, which is experimentally measured via the correlation between soft and hard hadrons, receives competing contributions from event-by-event fluctuations of the low $p_T$ elliptic flow and event plane angle fluctuations in the soft sector. In this paper, a proper account of these event-by-event fluctuations in the soft sector, modeled via viscous hydrodynamics, is combined with a jet energy loss model to reveal that the positive contribution from low $p_T$ $v_2$ fluctuations overwhelms the negative contributions from event plane fluctuations. This leads to an enhancement of high $p_T {\textgreater} 10$ GeV elliptic flow in comparison to previous calculations and provides a natural solution to the decade long high $p_T$ $R_{AA} {\textbackslash}otimes v_2$ puzzle. We also present the first theoretical calculation of high $p_T$ $v_3$, which is shown to be compatible with current LHC data. Furthermore, we discuss how short wavelength jet-medium physics can be deconvoluted from the physics of soft, bulk event-by-event flow observables using event shape engineering techniques.},

While shear viscosity is known to attenuate the flow harmonics, we find that the inclusion of bulk viscosity decreases the shear viscosity-induced suppression of the flow harmonics, bringing them closer to their values in ideal hydrodynamical calculations. Depending on the value of the bulk viscosity to entropy density ratio, ζ/s, in the quark-gluon plasma, the bulk viscosity-driven suppression of shear viscosity effects on the flow harmonics may require a reevaluation of the previous estimates of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, η/s, of the quark-gluon plasma previously extracted by comparing hydrodynamic calculations to heavy-ion data.},

	doi = {10.1103/PhysRevC.93.024909},
	abstract = {In this paper a new procedure to smooth out the initial energy densities of hydrodynamics is employed to show that the initial spatial eccentricities ${\textbackslash}varepsilon_{m,n}$, which drive the final state flow harmonics $v_n$, are remarkably robust with respect to variations of the underlying scale of initial energy density spatial gradients, ${\textbackslash}lambda$, in nucleus-nucleus collisions. For ${\textbackslash}sqrt{s}=2.76$ TeV Pb+Pb collisions, the ${\textbackslash}varepsilon_{m,n}$'s (across centrality classes) change by less than $10{\textbackslash}\%$ if the scale of fluctuations is varied from $0.1$ to $1$ fm. We show, using the 2+1 Lagrangian hydrodynamic code, v-USPhydro, that this robustness is transferred to the final $v_n$'s computed within event by event viscous hydrodynamics. This indicates that the flow harmonics in nucleus-nucleus collisions are not yet particularly sensitive to the underlying microscopic sub-nucleon physics below the confinement scale. On the other hand, the eccentricities of top $1{\textbackslash}\%$ high multiplicity ${\textbackslash}sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV p+Pb collisions are found to be very sensitive to sub-nucleonic scale fluctuations, which should be contrasted with the robustness found in peripheral Pb+Pb collisions with the same multiplicity.},

Starting with a nonaxisymmetric distribution of approximately 80 particles in three dimensions, the method is found to reproduce the structure of uniformly rotating and magnetic polytropes to within a few percent. The method may be easily extended to deal with more complicated physical models.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.7366},
	abstract = {Hadrons containing heavy-flavours, i.e. charm and beauty quarks, are unique probes of the properties of the hot and dense QCD medium produced in heavy-ion collisions. Due to their large masses, heavy quarks are produced at the initial stage of the collision, almost exclusively via hard partonic scattering processes. Therefore, they are expected to experience the full collision history propagating through and interacting with the QCD medium. The parton energy loss, which is sensitive to the transport coefficients of the produced medium, can be studied experimentally by measuring the nuclear modication factor ($R_{\rm AA}$) which accounts for the modication of the heavy-flavoured hadron yield in Pb-Pb collisions with respect to pp collisions. In semi-central Pb-Pb collisions, the degree of thermalization of charm quarks in the QCD medium can be accessed via the measurement of the heavy flavour elliptic flow $v_2$ at low $p_{\rm T}$ . At high $p_{\rm T}$, $v_2$ is sensitive to the path-length dependence of heavy quark in-medium energy loss. The ALICE collaboration has measured the production of open heavy flavour hadrons via their hadronic and semi-leptonic decays at mid-rapidity and in the semi-muonic decay channel at forward rapidity in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at 7, 5.02 and 2.76 TeV respectively. In this talk the current results on open heavy-flavour $R_{\rm AA}$ and $v_2$ will be presented.},

The resulting fluid dynamic equations are shown to be consistent for all these derivations, when properly accounting for the respective region of applicability, and can be applied to both weakly and strongly coupled systems. In its modern formulation, relativistic viscous hydrodynamics can directly be solved numerically. This has been useful for the problem of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, and I will review the setup and results of a hydrodynamic description of experimental data for this case.},
