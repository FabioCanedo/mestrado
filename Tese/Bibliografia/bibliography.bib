	abstract = {The interplay between shear and bulk viscosities on the flow harmonics, vn's, at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider is investigated using the newly developed relativistic 2+1 hydrodynamical code v-usphydro that includes bulk and shear viscosity effects both in the hydrodynamic evolution and at freeze-out. While shear viscosity is known to attenuate the flow harmonics, we find that the inclusion of bulk viscosity decreases the shear viscosity-induced suppression of the flow harmonics, bringing them closer to their values in ideal hydrodynamical calculations. Depending on the value of the bulk viscosity to entropy density ratio, ζ/s, in the quark-gluon plasma, the bulk viscosity-driven suppression of shear viscosity effects on the flow harmonics may require a reevaluation of the previous estimates of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, η/s, of the quark-gluon plasma previously extracted by comparing hydrodynamic calculations to heavy-ion data.},

	abstract = {High \$p\_T {\textgreater} 10\$ GeV elliptic flow, which is experimentally measured via the correlation between soft and hard hadrons, receives competing contributions from event-by-event fluctuations of the low \$p\_T\$ elliptic flow and event plane angle fluctuations in the soft sector. In this paper, a proper account of these event-by-event fluctuations in the soft sector, modeled via viscous hydrodynamics, is combined with a jet energy loss model to reveal that the positive contribution from low \$p\_T\$ \$v\_2\$ fluctuations overwhelms the negative contributions from event plane fluctuations. This leads to an enhancement of high \$p\_T {\textgreater} 10\$ GeV elliptic flow in comparison to previous calculations and provides a natural solution to the decade long high \$p\_T\$ \$R\_\{AA\} {\textbackslash}otimes v\_2\$ puzzle. We also present the first theoretical calculation of high \$p\_T\$ \$v\_3\$, which is shown to be compatible with current LHC data. Furthermore, we discuss how short wavelength jet-medium physics can be deconvoluted from the physics of soft, bulk event-by-event flow observables using event shape engineering techniques.},

The coupling between the jets and the medium is done through a source term in the energy-momentum conservation equations for ideal hydrodynamics. We concentrate our attention at mid-rapidity and solve the equations event-by-event imposing boost-invariance. For \$p\_T {\textbackslash}gtrsim 1\$ GeV the anisotropic flow is found to be considerably enhanced, if the dijets deposit on average more than 12 GeV in the medium (or equivalently 6 GeV for each jet of the pair), which corresponds, in our model, to an average suppression greater than \$65{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the initial jet transverse energy.},

This is followed by a brief discussion of bulk evolution models for heavy-ion collisions and initial conditions for the HQ distributions which are needed to calculate HF spectra in comparison to observables. We then turn to a discussion of experimental data that have been collected to date at RHIC and LHC, specifically for the nuclear suppression factor and elliptic flow of semileptonic HF decays, D mesons, non-prompt \$J/{\textbackslash}psi\$ from B-meson decays, and b-jets. Model comparisons to HF data are conducted with regards to extracting the magnitude, temperature and momentum-dependence of HF transport coefficients from experiment.},

	abstract = {Hadrons carrying open heavy flavor, i.e. single charm or bottom quarks, are among the key diagnostic tools available today for the hot and dense state of strongly interacting matter which is produced in collisions of heavy atomic nuclei at ultra-relativistic energies. First systematic heavy-flavor measurements in nucleus-nucleus collisions and the reference proton-proton system at Brookhaven National Laboratory's (BNL) Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) have led to tantalizing results. These studies are now continued and extended at RHIC and at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC), where considerably higher collision energies are available. This review focuses on experimental results on open heavy-flavor observables at RHIC and the LHC published until July 2012. Yields of heavy-flavor hadrons and their decay products, their transverse momentum and rapidity distributions, as well as their azimuthal distributions with respect to the reaction plane in heavy-ion collisions are investigated. Various theoretical approaches are confronted with the data and implications for the properties of the hot and dense medium produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions are discussed.},

This is done by comparing for each jet fragment the probability of further perturbative splitting with the density-dependent probability of scattering with the medium. A simple hadronisation mechanism is included. In the absence of medium effects, we validate JEWEL against a set of benchmark jet measurements. For elastic interactions with the medium, we characterise not only the medium-induced modification of the jet, but also the jet-induced modification of the medium. Our main physics result is the observation that collisional and radiative medium modifications lead to characteristic differences in the jet fragmentation pattern, which persist above a soft background cut. We argue that this should allow to disentangle collisional and radiative parton energy loss mechanisms by measuring the n-jet fraction or a class of jet shape observables.},

	abstract = {This is a review of the theoretical background, experimental techniques, and phenomenology of what is called the "Glauber Model" in relativistic heavy ion physics. This model is used to calculate "geometric" quantities, which are typically expressed as impact parameter (b), number of participating nucleons (N\_part) and number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions (N\_coll). A brief history of the original Glauber model is presented, with emphasis on its development into the purely classical, geometric picture that is used for present-day data analyses. Distinctions are made between the "optical limit" and Monte Carlo approaches, which are often used interchangably but have some essential differences in particular contexts. The methods used by the four RHIC experiments are compared and contrasted, although the end results are reassuringly similar for the various geometric observables. Finally, several important RHIC measurements are highlighted that rely on geometric quantities, estimated from Glauber calculations, to draw insight from experimental observables. The status and future of Glauber modeling in the next generation of heavy ion physics studies is briefly discussed.},

The hard part of HYDJET++ is identical to the hard part of Fortran-written HYDJET and it is included in the generator structure as a separate directory. The soft part of HYDJET++ event is the "thermal" hadronic state generated on the chemical and thermal freeze-out hypersurfaces obtained from the parameterization of relativistic hydrodynamics with preset freeze-out conditions. It includes the longitudinal, radial and elliptic flow effects and the decays of hadronic resonances. The corresponding fast Monte-Carlo simulation procedure, C++ code FAST MC (Amelin et al., 2006, PRC, 74, 064901; 2008, PRC, 77, 014903) is adapted to HYDJET++.

In this comparison, an identical medium evolution will be utilized for all three approaches: not only does this entail the use of the same realistic three-dimensional relativistic fluid dynamics (RFD) simulation, but also includes the use of identical initial parton-distribution functions and final fragmentation functions. We are, thus, in a unique position, not only to isolate fundamental differences between the various approaches, but also to make rigorous calculations for different experimental measurements using "state of the art" components. All three approaches are reduced to a version which contains only one free tunable parameter, this is then related to the well known transport parameter \${\textbackslash}textbackslashhat\{q\}\$. We find that the parameters of all three calculations can be adjusted to provide a good description of inclusive data on \$R\_\{AA\}\$ versus transverse momentum. However, we do observe slight differences in their predictions for the centrality and azimuthal angular dependence of \$R\_\{AA\}\$ vs. \$p\_T\$. We also note that the value of the transport coefficient \${\textbackslash}textbackslashhat\{q\}\$ in the three approaches to describe the data differs significantly.},

	abstract = {We construct a hadronic equation of state consistent with chemical freezeout and discuss how such an equation of state modifies the radial and elliptic flow in a hydrodynamic + hadronic cascade model of relativistic heavy ion collisions at the SPS. Incorporating chemical freezeout does not change the relation between pressure and energy density. However, it does change the relation between temperature and energy density. Consequently, when the hydrodynamic solution and freezeout are expressed in terms of energy density, chemical freezeout does not modify the hydrodynamic radial and elliptic flow velocities studied previously. Finally, we examine chemical freezeout within the hadronic cascade (RQMD). Once chemical freezeout is incorporated into the hydrodynamics, the final spectra and fireball lifetimes are insensitive to the temperature at which the switch from hydrodynamics to cascade is made. Closer inspection indicates that the pion spectrum in chemically frozen hydrodynamics is significantly cooler than in the hydro+cascade model. This difference is reflected in \$v\_\{2\}(p\_\{T\})\$. We extract the freezeout hadron density in RQMD and interpret it in thermal terms; the freezeout hadron density corresponds to a freezeout temperature of \$T\_\{f\}{\textbackslash}textbackslashapprox100 \$ MeV and \${\textbackslash}textbackslashmu\_\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashpi\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashapprox 80 \$ MeV.},

	abstract = {A measurement of the transverse momentum spectra of jets in Pb-Pb collisions at \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\_\{{\textbackslash}rm NN\}\}=2.76\$ TeV is reported. Jets are reconstructed from charged particles using the anti-\$k\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}\$ jet algorithm with jet resolution parameters \$R\$ of \$0.2\$ and \$0.3\$ in pseudo-rapidity \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}eta{\textbar}{\textless}0.5\$. The transverse momentum \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}\$ of charged particles is measured down to \$0.15\$ GeV/\$c\$ which gives access to the low \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}\$ fragments of the jet. Jets found in heavy-ion collisions are corrected event-by-event for average background density and on an inclusive basis (via unfolding) for residual background fluctuations and detector effects. A strong suppression of jet production in central events with respect to peripheral events is observed. The suppression is found to be similar to the suppression of charged hadrons, which suggests that substantial energy is radiated at angles larger than the jet resolution parameter \$R=0.3\$ considered in the analysis. The fragmentation bias introduced by selecting jets with a high \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}\$ leading particle, which rejects jets with a soft fragmentation pattern, has a similar effect on the jet yield for central and peripheral events. The ratio of jet spectra with \$R=0.2\$ and \$R=0.3\$ is found to be similar in Pb-Pb and simulated PYTHIA pp events, indicating no strong broadening of the radial jet structure in the reconstructed jets with \$R{\textless}0.3\$.},

	abstract = {ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose, heavy-ion detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the strong-interaction sector of the Standard Model. It is designed to address the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs. ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors. The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including currently over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes in 30 countries. Its overall dimensions are 16 × 16 × 26 m 3 with a total weight of approximately 10 000 t. The experiment consists of 18 different detector systems each with its own specific technology choice and design constraints, driven both by the physics requirements and the experimental conditions expected at LHC. The most stringent design constraint is to cope with the extreme particle multiplicity anticipated in central Pb-Pb collisions. The different subsystems were optimized to provide high-momentum resolution as well as excellent Particle Identification (PID) over a broad range in momentum, up to the highest multiplicities predicted for LHC. This will allow for comprehensive studies of hadrons, electrons, muons, and photons produced in the collision of heavy nuclei. Most detector systems are scheduled to be installed and ready for data taking by mid-2008 when the LHC is scheduled to start operation, with the exception of parts of the Photon Spectrometer (PHOS), Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) and Electro Magnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). These detectors will be completed for the high-luminosity ion run expected in 2010. This paper describes in detail the detector components as installed for the first data taking in the summer of 2008.},

	abstract = {The aim of this work is to explore possible medium modifications to the substructure of inclusive charged jets in Pb-Pb relative to proton-proton collisions by measuring a set of jet shapes. The set of shapes includes the radial moment, \$g\$, and the momentum dispersion \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{T\}\}\$D. They provide complementary information on the fragmentation and can help to discriminate between two different scenarios: intra-jet broadening or collimation as a result of jet quenching. {\textbackslash}noindent The shapes are measured in Pb--Pb collisions at \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\_\{NN\}\}\$ = 2.76 TeV with a constituent cutoff of 0.15 GeV/c and jet resolution \$R=\$ 0.2. New techniques for background subtraction are applied and a two-dimensional unfolding is performed to correct the shapes to particle level. The corrected jet shapes for jet \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{T\}\}\$ \$40{\textbackslash}le p\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{T,jet\}\} {\textbackslash}le 60\$ GeV/c are presented and discussed. The observed jet shape modifications suggest that the in-medium fragmentation is harder and more collimated than vacuum fragmentation as obtained by a PYTHIA calculation. The PYTHIA calculation is validated with proton-proton data at 7 TeV.},

The proper theoretical framework in which the problem can be formulated and treated is Wilson's operator product expansion (OPE). Two models developed for the description of duality violations are considered in some detail: one is instanton-based, another resonance-based. The mechanisms they represent are complementary. Although both models are rather primitive (their largest virtue is their simplicity) they hopefully capture important features of the phenomenon. Being open for improvements, they can be used "as is" for orientation in the studies of duality violations in the processes of practical interest.},

	abstract = {This letter presents the first measurement of jet mass in Pb-Pb and p-Pb collisions at \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\_\{{\textbackslash}rm NN\}\}\$ = 2.76 TeV and 5.02 TeV, respectively. Both the jet energy and the jet mass are expected to be sensitive to jet quenching in the hot Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) matter created in nuclear collisions at collider energies. Jets are reconstructed from charged particles using the anti-\$k\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}\$ jet algorithm and resolution parameter \$R = 0.4\$. The jets are measured in the pseudorapidity range \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}eta\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{jet\}\}{\textbar}{\textless}0.5\$ and in three intervals of transverse momentum between 60 GeV/\$c\$ and 120 GeV/\$c\$. The measurement of the jet mass in central Pb-Pb collisions is compared to the jet mass as measured in p-Pb reference collisions, to vacuum event generators, and to models including jet quenching. It is observed that the jet mass in central Pb-Pb collisions is consistent within uncertainties with p-Pb reference measurements. Furthermore, the measured jet mass in Pb-Pb collisions is not reproduced by the quenching models considered in this letter and is found to be consistent with PYTHIA expectations within systematic uncertainties.},

	abstract = {We present measurements of the azimuthal dependence of charged jet production in central and semi-central sNN=2.76 TeV Pb–Pb collisions with respect to the second harmonic event plane, quantified as v2ch jet. Jet finding is performed employing the anti-kT algorithm with a resolution parameter R=0.2 using charged tracks from the ALICE tracking system. The contribution of the azimuthal anisotropy of the underlying event is taken into account event-by-event. The remaining (statistical) region-to-region fluctuations are removed on an ensemble basis by unfolding the jet spectra for different event plane orientations independently. Significant non-zero v2ch jet is observed in semi-central collisions (30–50\% centrality) for 20{\textless}pTch jet{\textless}90 GeV/c. The azimuthal dependence of the charged jet production is similar to the dependence observed for jets comprising both charged and neutral fragments, and compatible with measurements of the v2 of single charged particles at high pT. Good agreement between the data and predictions from JEWEL, an event generator simulating parton shower evolution in the presence of a dense QCD medium, is found in semi-central collisions.},

	abstract = {A hot, dense medium called a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) is created in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. Hard parton scatterings generate high momentum partons that traverse the medium, which then fragment into sprays of particle called jets. Experimental measurements from high momentum hadrons, two particle correlations, and full jet reconstruction at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) continue to improve our understanding of energy loss in the QGP. Run 2 at the LHC recently began and there is a jet detector at RHIC under development. Now is the perfect time to reflect on what the experimental measurements have taught us so far, the limitations of the techniques used for studying jets, how the techniques can be improved, and how to move forward with the wealth of experimental data such that a complete description of energy loss in the QGP can be achieved. Measurements of jets to date clearly indicate that hard partons lose energy. Detailed comparisons of the nuclear modification factor between data and model calculations led to quantitative constraints on the opacity of the medium to hard probes. While there is substantial evidence for softening and broadening jets through medium interactions, the difficulties comparing measurements to theoretical calculations limit further quantitative constraints on energy loss mechanisms. We call for an agreement between theorists and experimentalists on the appropriate treatment of the background, Monte Carlo generators that enable experimental algorithms to be applied to theoretical calculations, and a clear understanding of which observables are most sensitive to the properties of the medium, even in the presence of background.

I compare the strength of this effect between N=4 gauge theory and QCD, using the static force between external quarks to normalize the ’t Hooft coupling. Comparing N=4 and QCD at fixed energy density then leads to a relaxation time of roughly 2 fm/c for charm quarks moving through a quark-gluon plasma at T=250 MeV. This estimate should be regarded as preliminary because of the difficulties of comparing two such different theories.},

	abstract = {We study the transverse momentum dependence of the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect in QED, starting from the high energy expansion of the solution of the Dirac equation in the presence of an external field. The angular integrated energy loss formula differs from an earlier expression of Zakharov by taking finite kinematical boundaries into account. In an expansion in powers of the opacity of the medium, we derive explicit expressions for the radiation cross section associated with N=1, 2 and 3 scatterings. We verify the Bethe-Heitler and the factorization limit, and we calculate corrections to the factorization limit proportional to the square of the target size. A closed form expression valid to arbitrary orders in the opacity is derived in the dipole approximation. The resulting radiation spectrum is non-analytic in the coupling constant which is traced back to the transverse momentum broadening of a hard parton undergoing multiple small angle Moliere scattering. In extending the results to QCD, we test a previously used dipole prescription by comparing to direct pQCD results for N=1 and 2. For N=1, the QCD dipole prescription reproduces exactly the Bertsch-Gunion radiation spectrum. For N=2, we find a sizeable correction which reduces to a multiplicative factor 17/8 at large separation.},

The distributions are found to be similar in peripheral Pb+Pb collisions and \$pp\$ collisions, but highly modified in central Pb+Pb collisions. Similar features are present in both the \$R=0.3\$ and \$R=0.4\$ results, indicating that the effects of the underlying event are properly accounted for in the measurement.

	abstract = {Jet quenching in heavy ion collisions is expected to be accompanied by recoil effects, but unambiguous signals for the induced medium response have been difficult to identify so far. Here, we argue that modern jet substructure measurements can improve this situation qualitatively since they are sensitive to the momentum distribution inside the jet. We show that the groomed subjet shared momentum fraction \$z\_g\$, and the girth of leading and subleading subjets signal recoil effects with dependencies that are absent in a recoilless baseline. We find that recoil effects can explain most of the medium modifications to the \$z\_g\$ distribution observed in data. Furthermore, for jets passing the Soft Drop Condition, recoil effects induce in the differential distribution of subjet separation \${\textbackslash}Delta R\_\{12\}\$ a characteristic increase with \${\textbackslash}Delta R\_\{12\}\$, and they introduce a characteristic enhancement of the girth of the subleading subjet with decreasing \$z\_g\$. We explain why these qualitatively novel features, that we establish in {\textbackslash}textsc\{Jewel+Pythia\} simulations, reflect generic physical properties of recoil effects that should therefore be searched for as telltale signatures of jet-induced medium response.},

We exploit jet and subjet features to highlight differences between quark and gluon jets in vacuum and in a medium with the jet-quenching model implemented in JEWEL. We begin with a physics-motivated, multivariate analysis of jet substructure observables including the jet mass, the radial moments, the \$p\_T{\textasciicircum}D\$ and the pixel multiplicity. In comparison, we employ state-of-the-art image-recognition techniques by training a deep convolutional neutral network on jet images. To systematically extract jet substructure information, we introduce the telescoping deconstruction framework exploiting subjet kinematics at multiple angular scales. We draw connections to the soft-drop subjet distribution and illuminate medium-induced jet modifications using Lund diagrams. We find that the quark gluon discrimination performance worsens in heavy ion jets due to significant soft event activity affecting the soft jet substructure. Our work suggests a systematically improvable framework for studying modifications to quark and gluon jet substructures and facilitating direct comparisons between theoretical calculations, simulations and measurements in heavy ion collisions.},

The first strategy is aimed at testing the kinematics of heavy-flavor quarks within an identified jet. Here, we use the SoftDrop jet-declustering algorithm to identify two subjets within a large-radius jet, using subjet flavor tagging to test the heavy-quark splitting functions of QCD. For subjets containing a \$J / {\textbackslash}psi\$ or \${\textbackslash}Upsilon\$, this declustering technique can also help probe the mechanism for quarkonium production. The second strategy is aimed at isolating heavy-flavor production from gluon splitting. Here, we introduce a new FlavorCone algorithm, which smoothly interpolates from well-separated heavy-quark jets to the gluon-splitting regime where jets overlap. Because of its excellent ability to identify charm and beauty hadrons, the LHCb detector is ideally suited to pursue these strategies, though similar measurements should also be possible at ATLAS and CMS. Together, these SoftDrop and FlavorCone studies should clarify a number of aspects of heavy-flavor physics at colliders, and provide crucial information needed to improve heavy-flavor modeling in parton-shower generators.},

The objective is to provide as accurate as possible a representation of event properties in a wide range of reactions, within and beyond the Standard Model, with emphasis on those where strong interactions play a role, directly or indirectly, and therefore multihadronic final states are produced. The physics is then not understood well enough to give an exact description; instead the program has to be based on a combination of analytical results and various QCD-based models. This physics input is summarized here, for areas such as hard subprocesses, initial- and final-state parton showers, underlying events and beam remnants, fragmentation and decays, and much more. Furthermore, extensive information is provided on all program elements: subroutines and functions, switches and parameters, and particle and process data. This should allow the user to tailor the generation task to the topics of interest.},

The calculations are based on the ﬁnite-range droplet macroscopic model and the folded-Yukawa single-particle microscopic model. Relative to our FRDM(1992) mass table in ATOMIC DATA AND NUCLEAR DATA TABLES [59 185 (1995)], the results are obtained in the same model, but with considerably improved treatment of deformation and fewer of the approximations that were necessary earlier, due to limitations in computer power. The more accurate execution of the model and the more extensive and more accurate experimental mass data base now available allows us to determine one additional macroscopic-model parameter, the density-symmetry coefﬁcient L, which was not varied in the previous calculation, but set to zero. Because we now realize that the FRDM is inaccurate for some highly deformed shapes occurring in ﬁssion, because some effects are derived in terms of perturbations around a sphere, we only adjust its macroscopic parameters to ground-state masses.},

	abstract = {The quark-gluon matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions may contain local domains in which P and CP symmetries are not preserved. When coupled with an external magnetic field, such P- and CP-odd domains will generate electric currents along the magnetic field --- a phenomenon called the chiral magnetic effect (CME). Recently, the STAR Collaboration at RHIC and the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC released data of charge-dependent azimuthal-angle correlators with features consistent with the CME expectation. However, the experimental observable is contaminated with significant background contributions from elliptic-flow-driven effects, which makes the interpretation of the data ambiguous. In this Letter, we show that the collisions of isobaric nuclei, \${\textasciicircum}\{96\}\_\{44\}\$Ru + \${\textasciicircum}\{96\}\_\{44\}\$Ru and \${\textasciicircum}\{96\}\_\{40\}\$Zr + \${\textasciicircum}\{96\}\_\{40\}\$Zr, provide an ideal tool to disentangle the CME signal from the background effects. Our simulation demonstrates that the two collision types at \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\_\{{\textbackslash}rm NN\}\}=200\$ GeV have more than \$10{\textbackslash}\%\$ difference in the CME signal and less than \$2{\textbackslash}\%\$ difference in the elliptic-flow-driven backgrounds for the centrality range of \$20-60{\textbackslash}\%\$.},

This is in disagreement with the expected dominance of the energy loss via gluon radiation, which predicts a much weaker suppression of heavy flavours due to the dead cone effect. However, collisional energy loss is also important, as demonstrated recently by the Soft Colour Interaction Jet Quenching model. Based on this model we show that collisional energy loss of charm quarks gives a suppression of electrons of the observed magnitude, but the contribution from beauty decays, which dominates at intermediate and large pT, results in a somewhat weaker overall suppression of electrons than observed.},

Furthermore, due to mass effects the energy loss of jets is expected to be sensitive to the flavor of the shower-initiating parton. For investigating the medium modification of parton showers, we employ the transport approach Bamps, which numerically solves the (3+1)D Boltzmann equation for gluons, light and heavy quarks based on pQCD cross sections for both 2→2 and 2↔3 processes. While employing an improved Gunion-Bertsch matrix element together with a running coupling, Bamps simulations show a good agreement with data for both RAA and the elliptic flow v2. We review recent results about the RAA of inclusive and b-tagged reconstructed jets and the modification of its underlying jet shapes.},

Recent results from experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) show evidence for an unexpectedly similar suppression of both light and heavy flavor jets. Furthermore, the role of radiative energy loss of heavy quarks is still under active discussion within the theoretical community. By employing the parton cascade Boltzmann Approach to Multi-Parton Scatterings (BAMPS), which numerically solves the 3+1D Boltzmann equation both for light and heavy flavor partons, we calculate the nuclear modification factor of inclusive and b-tagged reconstructed jets in 0-10\% central \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\_\{{\textbackslash}rm LHC\}\}\$ = 2.76 ATeV Pb+Pb collisions. Based on perturbative QCD cross sections we find a suppression of both light and heavy flavor jets. While the inclusive jets are slightly too strong suppressed within BAMPS in comparison with data, both elastic+radiative and only elastic interactions lead to a realistic b-tagged jet suppression. To further investigate light and heavy flavor energy loss we predict the R dependence of inclusive and b-tagged jet suppression. Furthermore, we propose the medium modification of b-tagged jet shapes as an observable for discriminating between different heavy quark energy loss scenarios.},

	abstract = {Discriminating quark jets from gluon jets is an important but challenging problem in jet substructure. In this paper, we use the concept of mutual information to illuminate the physics of quark/gluon tagging. Ideal quark/gluon separation requires only one bit of truth information, so even if two discriminant variables are largely uncorrelated, they can still share the same "truth overlap". Mutual information can be used to diagnose such situations, and thus determine which discriminant variables are redundant and which can be combined to improve performance. Using both parton showers and analytic resummation, we study a two-parameter family of generalized angularities, which includes familiar infrared and collinear (IRC) safe observables like thrust and broadening, as well as IRC unsafe variants like \$p\_T{\textasciicircum}D\$ and hadron multiplicity. At leading-logarithmic (LL) order, the bulk of these variables exhibit Casimir scaling, such that their truth overlap is a universal function of the color factor ratio \$C\_A/C\_F\$. Only at next-to-leading-logarithmic (NLL) order can one see a difference in quark/gluon performance. For the IRC safe angularities, we show that the quark/gluon performance can be improved by combining angularities with complementary angular exponents. Interestingly, LL order, NLL order, Pythia 8, and Herwig++ all exhibit similar correlations between observables, but there are significant differences in the predicted quark/gluon discrimination power. For the IRC unsafe angularities, we show that the mutual information can be calculated analytically with the help of a nonperturbative "weighted-energy function", providing evidence for the complementarity of safe and unsafe observables for quark/gluon discrimination.},

Observables that are calculable in this way are known as "safe". Recently, a class of unsafe observables was discovered that do not have a valid \${\textbackslash}alpha\_s\$ expansion but are nevertheless calculable in pQCD using all-orders resummation. These observables are called "Sudakov safe" since singularities at each \${\textbackslash}alpha\_s\$ order are regulated by an all-orders Sudakov form factor. In this letter, we give a concrete definition of Sudakov safety based on conditional probability distributions, and we study a one-parameter family of momentum sharing observables that interpolate between the safe and unsafe regimes. The boundary between these regimes is particularly interesting, as the resulting distribution can be understood as the ultraviolet fixed point of a generalized fragmentation function, yielding a leading behavior that is independent of \${\textbackslash}alpha\_s\$.},

	abstract = {We present the mea√surement of a new set of jet shape observables for track-based jets in central Pb–Pb collisions at sNN = 2.76 TeV. The set of jet shapes includes the ﬁrst radial moment or angularity, g; the momentum dispersion, pTD; and the difference between the leading and sub-leading constituent track transverse momentum, LeSub. These observables provide complementary information on the jet fragmentation and can constrain different aspects of the theoretical description of jet-medium interactions. The jet shapes were measured for a small resolution parameter R = 0.2 and were fully corrected to particle level. The observed jet shape modiﬁcations indicate that in-medium fragmentation is harder and more collimated than vacuum fragmentation as obtained by PYTHIA calc√ulations, which were validated with the measurements of the jet shapes in proton-proton collisions at s = 7 TeV. The comparison of the measured distributions to templates for quark and gluon-initiated jets indicates that in-medium fragmentation resembles that of quark jets in vacuum. We further argue that the observed modiﬁcations are not consistent with a totally coherent energy loss picture where the jet loses energy as a single colour charge, suggesting that the medium resolves the jet structure at the angular scales probed by our measurements (R = 0.2). Furthermore, we observe that small-R jets can help to isolate purely energy loss effects from other effects that contribute to the modiﬁcations of the jet shower in medium such as the correlated background or medium response.},

	abstract = {We study the relation between the Baier-Dokshitzer-Mueller-Peigne-Schiff (BDMPS) and Zakharov formalisms for medium-induced gluon radiation off hard quarks, and the radiation off very few scattering centers. Based on the non-abelian Furry approximation for the motion of hard partons in a spatially extended colour field, we derive a compact diagrammatic and explicitly colour trivial expression for the N-th order term of the kt-differential gluon radiation cross section in an expansion in the opacity of the medium. Resumming this quantity to all orders in opacity, we obtain Zakharov's path-integral expression (supplemented with a regularization prescription). This provides a new proof of the equivalence of the BDMPS and Zakharov formalisms which extends previous arguments to the kt-differential cross section. We give explicit analytical results up to third order in opacity for both the gluon radiation cross section of free incoming and of in-medium produced quarks. The N-th order term in the opacity expansion of the radiation cross section is found to be a convolution of the radiation associated to N-fold rescattering and a readjustment of the probabilities that rescattering occurs with less than N scattering centers. Both informations can be disentangled by factorizing out of the radiation cross section a term which depends only on the mean free path of the projectile. This allows to infer analytical expressions for the totally coherent and totally incoherent limits of the radiation cross section to arbitrary orders in opacity.},

The modified pattern of the final detected hadrons is then a probe of the structure of the medium as perceived by the jet. Starting from the factorization paradigm developed for the case of particle collisions, we review the basic underlying theory of medium induced gluon radiation based on perturbative Quantum Chromo Dynamics (pQCD) and current experimental results from Deep Inelastic Scattering on large nuclei and high energy heavy-ion collisions, emphasizing how these results constrain our understanding of energy loss. This review contains introductions to the theory of radiative energy loss, elastic energy loss, and the corresponding experimental observables and issues.

	abstract = {A systematic expansion of the induced inclusive gluon radiation associated with jet production in a dense QCD plasma is derived using a reaction operator formalism. Analytic expressions for the transverse momentum and light-cone momentum distributions are derived to all orders in powers of the gluon opacity of the medium, \$N{\textbackslash}sigma\_g/A=L/{\textbackslash}lambda\_g\$. The reaction operator approach also leads to a simple algebraic proof of the ``color triviality'' of single inclusive distributions and to a solvable set of recursion relations. The analytic solution generalizes previous continuum solutions (BDMPS) for applications to mesoscopic QCD plasmas. The solution is furthermore not restricted to uncorrelated geometries and allows for evolving screening scales as well as the inclusion of finite kinematic constraints. The later is particularly important because below LHC energies the kinematic constraints significantly decrease the non-abelian energy loss. Our solution for the inclusive distribution also generalizes the finite order exclusive (tagged) distribution case studied previously (GLV1). The form of the analytic solution is well suited for numerical implementation in Monte Carlo event generators to enable more accurate calculations of jet quenching in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions. Numerical results illustrating the constributions of the first three orders in opacity are compared to the ``self-quenching'' hard radiation intensity. A surprising result is that the induced gluon radiation intensity is dominated by the (quadratic in \$L\$) first order opacity contribution for realistic geometries and jet energies in nuclear collisions.},

	abstract = {The non-abelian analog of the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect is investigated in perturbative QCD. Extending our previous studies, the suppression of induced soft bremsstrahlung due to multiple scatterings of quarks in the spinor representation is considered. The effective formation time of gluon radiation due to the color interference is shown to depend on the color representation of the emitting parton, and an improved formula for the radiative energy loss is derived that interpolates between the factorization and Bethe-Heitler limits.},

	abstract = {The first measurement of jet shapes, defined as the fractional transverse momentum radial distribution, for inclusive jets produced in heavy-ion collisions is presented. Data samples of PbPb and pp collisions, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 150 μb−1 and 5.3 pb−1 respectively, were collected at a nucleon–nucleon centre-of-mass energy of sNN=2.76 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. The jets are reconstructed with the anti-kT algorithm with a distance parameter R=0.3, and the jet shapes are measured for charged particles with transverse momentum pT{\textgreater}1 GeV/c. The jet shapes measured in PbPb collisions in different collision centralities are compared to reference distributions based on the pp data. A centrality-dependent modification of the jet shapes is observed in the more central PbPb collisions, indicating a redistribution of the energy inside the jet cone. This measurement provides information about the parton shower mechanism in the hot and dense medium produced in heavy-ion collisions.},

	abstract = {Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are the standard tool for describing jet-like multi-particle final states. To apply them to the simulation of medium-modified jets in heavy ion collisions, a probabilistic implementation of medium-induced quantum interference effects is needed. Here, we analyze in detail how the quantum interference effects included in the BDMPS-Z formalism of medium-induced gluon radiation can be implemented in a quantitatively controlled, local probabilistic parton cascade. The resulting MC algorithm is formulated in terms of elastic and inelastic mean free paths, and it is by construction insensitive to the IR and UV divergences of the total elastic and inelastic cross sections that serve as its basic building blocks in the incoherent limit. Interference effects are implemented by reweighting gluon production histories as a function of the number of scattering centers that act within the gluon formation time. Unlike existing implementations based on gluon formation time, we find generic arguments for why a quantitative implementation of quantum interference cannot amount to a mere dead-time requirement for subsequent gluon production. We validate the proposed MC algorithm by comparing MC simulations with parametric dependencies and analytical results of the BDMPS-Z formalism. In particular, we show that the MC algorithm interpolates correctly between analytically known limiting cases for totally coherent and incoherent gluon production, and that it accounts quantitatively for the medium-induced gluon energy distribution and the resulting average parton energy loss. We also verify that the MC algorithm implements the transverse momentum broadening of the BDMPS-Z formalism. We finally discuss why the proposed MC algorithm provides a suitable starting point for going beyond the approximations of the BDMPS-Z formalism.},

	abstract = {The splitting processes of bremsstrahlung and pair production in a medium are coherent over large distances in the very high energy limit, which leads to a suppression known as the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect. We analyze the case when the coherence lengths of two consecutive splitting processes overlap, which is important for understanding corrections to standard treatments of the LPM effect in QCD. Previous authors have analyzed this problem in the case of overlapping double bremsstrahlung where at least one of the bremsstrahlung gluons is soft. Here we show how to generalize to include the case where both splittings are hard. A number of techniques must be developed, and so in this paper we simplify by (i) restricting attention to a subset of the interference effects, which we call the "crossed" diagrams, and (ii) working in the large-\$N\_c\$ limit. We first develop some general formulas that could in principle be implemented numerically (with substantial difficulty). To make more analytic progress, we then focus on the case of a thick, homogeneous medium and make the multiple scattering approximation (also known as the \${\textbackslash}hat q\$ or harmonic approximation) appropriate at high energy. We show that the differential rate \$d{\textbackslash}Gamma/dx{\textbackslash},dy\$ for overlapping double bremsstrahlung of gluons with momentum fractions \$x\$ and \$y\$ can then be reduced to the calculation of a 1-dimensional integral, which we perform numerically.

In JEWEL, all partons belonging to the parton showers initiated by hard scattered partons undergo collisions with thermal partons from the medium, leading to both elastic and radiative energy loss. The recoiling medium partons carry away energy and momentum from the jet. Since the thermal component of these recoils' momenta is part of the soft background activity, comparison with data requires the implementation of a subtraction procedure. We present two independent procedures through which background subtraction can be performed and discuss the impact of the medium recoil on jet shape observables.

The rescattering of hard partons in the medium is modelled by infrared continued pQCD matrix elements supplemented with parton showers. The latter approximate higher order real-emission matrix elements and thus generate medium-induced gluon emissions. The interplay between different emissions is governed by their formation times. The destructive interference between subsequent scattering processes, the non-Abelian version of the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect, is also taken into account. In this way the complete radiation pattern is consistently treated in a uniform way. Results obtained within this minimal and theoretically well constrained framework are compared with a variety of experimental data susceptible to jet-quenching effects at both RHIC and the LHC. Overall, a good agreement between data and simulation is found. This new framework also allows to identify and quantify the dominant uncertainties in the simulation, and we show some relevant examples for this.},

	abstract = {The mass of heavy quarks, such as charm and bottom, plays an important role in the formation of parton showers. This effect is apparently not well understood when parton showers evolve in a strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma. We propose a new experimental measurement in relativistic heavy ion collisions, based on a two-prong subjet structure inside a reconstructed heavy flavor jet, which can place stringent constraints on the mass dependence of in-medium splitting functions. We identify the region of jet transverse momenta where parton mass effects are leading and predict a unique reversal of the mass hierarchy of jet quenching effects in heavy ion relative to proton collisions. Namely, the momentum sharing distribution of prompt \$b\$-tagged jets is more strongly modified in comparison to the one for light jets. Our work is useful in guiding experimental efforts at the Large Hadron Collider and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in the near future.},

	abstract = {Within the last years, HepMC has established itself as the standard event format for simulation of high-energy physics interactions and is commonly used by all LHC experiments. At the energies of the proton-proton collisisions at the LHC, a full description of the generation of these events and the subsequent interactions with the detector typically involves several thousand particles and several hundred vertices. Currently, the HepMC library only provides a text-based representation of these events. HepMCVisual is a visualization package for HepMC events, allowing to interactively browse through the event. Intuitive user guiding and the possibility of expanding/collapsing specific branches of the interaction tree allow quick navigation and visualization of the specific parts of the event of interest to the user. Thus, it may be a valuble tool not only for physics users but also for debugging MonteCarlo event generators. Being based on the ROOT graphics libraries, HepMC visual can be used as a standalone library, as well as interactively from the ROOT console or in combination with the HepMCBrowser interface within the ATLAS software framework.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.7366},
	abstract = {Hadrons containing heavy-flavours, i.e. charm and beauty quarks, are unique probes of the properties of the hot and dense QCD medium produced in heavy-ion collisions. Due to their large masses, heavy quarks are produced at the initial stage of the collision, almost exclusively via hard partonic scattering processes. Therefore, they are expected to experience the full collision history propagating through and interacting with the QCD medium. The parton energy loss, which is sensitive to the transport coefficients of the produced medium, can be studied experimentally by measuring the nuclear modication factor (\$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm AA\}\$) which accounts for the modication of the heavy-flavoured hadron yield in Pb-Pb collisions with respect to pp collisions. In semi-central Pb-Pb collisions, the degree of thermalization of charm quarks in the QCD medium can be accessed via the measurement of the heavy flavour elliptic flow \$v\_2\$ at low \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}\$ . At high \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}\$, \$v\_2\$ is sensitive to the path-length dependence of heavy quark in-medium energy loss. The ALICE collaboration has measured the production of open heavy flavour hadrons via their hadronic and semi-leptonic decays at mid-rapidity and in the semi-muonic decay channel at forward rapidity in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at 7, 5.02 and 2.76 TeV respectively. In this talk the current results on open heavy-flavour \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm AA\}\$ and \$v\_2\$ will be presented.},

	abstract = {In this paper a new procedure to smooth out the initial energy densities of hydrodynamics is employed to show that the initial spatial eccentricities \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\_\{m,n\}\$, which drive the final state flow harmonics \$v\_n\$, are remarkably robust with respect to variations of the underlying scale of initial energy density spatial gradients, \${\textbackslash}lambda\$, in nucleus-nucleus collisions. For \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\}=2.76\$ TeV Pb+Pb collisions, the \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\_\{m,n\}\$'s (across centrality classes) change by less than \$10{\textbackslash}\%\$ if the scale of fluctuations is varied from \$0.1\$ to \$1\$ fm. We show, using the 2+1 Lagrangian hydrodynamic code, v-USPhydro, that this robustness is transferred to the final \$v\_n\$'s computed within event by event viscous hydrodynamics. This indicates that the flow harmonics in nucleus-nucleus collisions are not yet particularly sensitive to the underlying microscopic sub-nucleon physics below the confinement scale. On the other hand, the eccentricities of top \$1{\textbackslash}\%\$ high multiplicity \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{s\}=5.02\$ TeV p+Pb collisions are found to be very sensitive to sub-nucleonic scale fluctuations, which should be contrasted with the robustness found in peripheral Pb+Pb collisions with the same multiplicity.},

The authors make these subjects accessible through carefully worked examples illustrating the technical aspects of the subject, and intuitive explanations of what is going on behind the mathematics. After presenting the basics of quantum electrodynamics, the authors discuss the theory of renormalization and its relation to statistical mechanics, and introduce the renormalization group. This discussion sets the stage for a discussion of the physical principles that underlie the fundamental interactions of elementary particle physics and their description by gauge field theories.},

The new ansatz for the unintegrated gluon distribution function preserves factorization, and the saturation scale is bound from below by that for a single nucleon. It also reproduces the correct scaling with the number of collisions at high transverse momentum. The corresponding Monte Carlo implementation allows us to account for fluctuations of the hard sources (nucleons) in the transverse plane. We compute various definitions of the eccentricity within the new approach, which are relevant for the interpretation of the elliptic flow. Our approach predicts breaking of the scaling of the eccentricity with the Glauber eccentricity at the level of about 30\%.},

	abstract = {Anisotropic flow coefficients v\_1-v\_5 in heavy ion collisions are computed by combining a classical Yang-Mills description of the early time glasma flow with the subsequent relativistic viscous hydrodynamic evolution of matter through the quark-gluon plasma and hadron gas phases. The glasma dynamics, as realized in the IP-Glasma model, takes into account event-by-event geometric fluctuations in nucleon positions and intrinsic sub-nucleon scale color charge fluctuations; the pre-equilibrium flow of matter is then matched to the MUSIC algorithm describing viscous hydrodynamic flow and particle production at freeze-out. The IP-Glasma+MUSIC model describes well both transverse momentum dependent and integrated v\_n data measured at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The model also reproduces the event-by-event distributions of v\_2, v\_3 and v\_4 measured by the ATLAS collaboration. The implications of our results for better understanding of the dynamics of the glasma as well as for the extraction of transport properties of the quark-gluon plasma are outlined.},

In addition to fluctuations of nucleon positions, this impact parameter dependent Glasma description includes quantum fluctuations of color charges on the length scale determined by the inverse nuclear saturation scale Qs. The model naturally produces initial energy fluctuations that are described by a negative binomial distribution. The ratio of triangularity to eccentricity ε3/ε2 is close to that in a model tuned to reproduce experimental flow data.

Topics covered include the intermediate state of supraconductors; the absorption of sound in solids; the properties of metals at very low temperatures; and production of showers by heavy particles. This volume is comprised of 100 chapters and begins with Landau's paper on the theory of the spectra of diatomic molecules, followed by his studies on the damping problem in wave mechanics; quantum electrodynamics in configuration space; electron motion in crystal lattices; and the internal temperature of stars. Some of Landau's theories, such as those of stars, energy transfer on collisions, phase transitions, and specific heat anomalies are discussed. Subsequent chapters focus on the structure of the undisplaced scattering line; the transport equation in the case of Coulomb interactions; scattering of light by light; and the origin of stellar energy. This book will be a valuable resource for physicists as well as physics students and researchers.},

A strong magnetic field can affect the character and location of the QCD critical point, influence the QCD phases, and lead to anomalous transport of charge. To take advantage of the magnetic field as a probe of QCD at higher baryon densities, we are going to need experiments capable to scan the lower energy region. In this context, the nuclotron-based ion collider facility (NICA) at JINR offers a unique opportunity to explore such a region and complement alternative programs at RHIC and other facilities. In this paper we discuss some relevant problems of the interplay between QCD and magnetic fields and the important role the experiments at NICA can play in tackling them.},

	doi = {10.3390/universe4090096},
	abstract = {Within the first few microseconds from after the Big Bang, the hot dense matter was in the form of the Quark Gluon Plasm (QGP) consisting of free quarks and gluons. By colliding heavy nuclei at RHIC and LHC at a velocity close to the speed of light, we were able to create the primordial matter and observe the matter after expansion and cooling. In this report we present the thermodynamics and transport coefficients obtained in the framework of clustering of color sources in both hadron-hadron and nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. Multiparticle production at high energies can be described in terms of color strings stretched between the projectile and target. At high string density single strings overlap and form color sources. This addition belongs to the non-perturbative domain of Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QGP) and manifests its most fundamental features. The Schwinger Q E D 2 mechanism produces color neutral q q ¯ pairs when color source strings break. Subsequent hardonization produces the observed hadrons. With growing energy and atomic number of the colliding nuclei the density of strings grows and more color sources form clusters in the transverse plane. At a certain critical density a macroscopic cluster appears, which marks the percolation phase transition. This is the Color String Percolation Model (CSPM). The critical density is identified as the deconfinement transition and happens at the hadronization temperature. The stochastic thermalization in p p and A-A is a consequence of the quantum tunneling through the event horizon introduced by the confining color fields, the Hawking-Unruh effect. The percolation approach within CSPM is successfully used to describe the crossover phase transition in the soft collision region. The same phenomenology when applied to both hadron-hadron and nucleus-nucleus collisions emphasizes the importance of color string density, creating a macroscopic cluster which identifies the connectivity required for a finite droplet of the QGP.},

Jets were reconstructed from charged and neutral particles, utilizing the ALICE tracking detectors and Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal), with the anti-\$k\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}\$ jet algorithm with a resolution parameter of R=0.2. The jet \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}\$ spectra are reported in the pseudorapidity interval of \${\textbar}\{{\textbackslash}eta\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm jet\}{\textbar}{\textless}0.5\$ for \$40{\textless}p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T,jet\}{\textless}120\$ GeV/\$c\$ in 0-10\% and for \$30{\textless}p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T,jet\}{\textless}100\$ GeV/\$c\$ in 10-30\% collisions. Reconstructed jets were required to contain a leading charged particle with \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T\}{\textgreater}5\$ GeV/\$c\$ to suppress jets constructed from the combinatorial background in Pb-Pb collisions. The effect of the leading charged particle requirement has been studied in both pp and Pb-Pb collisions and has been shown to have negligible effects on the \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm AA\}\$ within the uncertainties of the measurement. The nuclear modification factor is obtained by dividing the jet spectrum measured in Pb-Pb by that in pp collisions scaled by the number of independent nucleon-nucleon collisions estimated using a Glauber model. \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm AA\}\$ is found to be \$0.28{\textbackslash}pm0.04\$ in 0-10\% and \$0.35{\textbackslash}pm0.04\$ in 10-30\% collisions, independent of \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}rm T,jet\}\$ within the uncertainties of the measurement.

The reduction of \$v\_\{2\}\$ is more effective at low \$p\_\{T\}\$ compared to the case of shear viscosity, whereas at high \$p\_\{T\}\$, the situation is reversed, leading to \$v\_\{2\}\$ enhancement.

	abstract = {Written primarily for researchers and graduate students who are new in this emerging field, this book develops the necessary tools so that readers can follow the latest advances in this subject. Readers are first guided to examine the basic informations on nucleon-nucleon collisions and the use of the nucleus as an arena to study the interaction of one nucleon with another. A good survey of the relation between nucleon-nucleon and nucleus-nucleus collisions provides the proper comparison to study phenomena involving the more exotic quark-gluon plasma. Properties of the quark-gluon plasma and signatures for its detection are discussed to aid future searches and exploration for this exotic matter. Recent experimental findings are summarised.},
